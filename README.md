# TorontoCoin
A new local community token for Toronto: An asset-backed circular economy token with demurrage and a charity component built in, that's soft-pegged to the value of the TTC Tokens. Not technically a stable coin but almost.

## Overview
TorontoCoin (TTC) aims to create a sustainable and inclusive economic system for the Toronto community. This token is designed to promote local commerce, support charitable initiatives, and maintain stable value through asset backing and demurrage mechanisms.

## Key Features
- Asset-Backed: TTC is backed by real-world assets to maintain value.
- Circular Economy: Encourages spending within the community to boost local businesses.
- Demurrage: A small fee on holding TTC to incentivize spending and circulation.
- Charity Component: A portion of transaction fees is allocated to local charities.
